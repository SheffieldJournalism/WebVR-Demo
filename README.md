# Embedding 360 images

This example uses the [A-Frame Web VR framework](https://aframe.io/). 

You can see this web page served here:
[https://sheffieldjournalism.github.io/WebVR-Demo/](https://sheffieldjournalism.github.io/WebVR-Demo/)

To use this demo in your own page, you can do this in one of two ways:

1. Fork the repository and use as a standalone project
2. Download the repository and incorporate into your own project

Regardless of which method you use, you will need to host your 360 object on GitHub and embed it into youe web page.

### Forking the repo

If you choose to fork the repository, you need to change the image file to that of your own i.e upload the image file to GitHub and change the path in your HTML file.

### Incorporating into your own project

You will need to download the repository and extract it, then do the following:

1. rename the index.html file
2. add your own image 
3. change the path to the image in the html file
4. copy the html file, aframe folder and image to your project file
5. sync your projec back to GitHub
